# Todo list

- Add the functionality to switch/dim devices using BLE.
- Add the dimming capability for devices, as of now the devices only have the capability to switch.
- Add a way for the user to choose a specific sphere first when adding new devices thus removing the need for checking the location of the user for the sphere ID every time.
- Add a login form on the page where the user is adding devices, instead of it being hidden away in the settings.
- Add the functionality where the icons of the rooms defined in the Crownstone App are shown on the Homey App.
