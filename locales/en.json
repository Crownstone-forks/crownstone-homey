The Crownstone app can be running in the background on your phone, as long as Bluetooth is enabled. The Crownstones can also be controlled directly over Bluetooth, but they will have to be close to the Homey. Bluetooth on the Homey is still in development and that means for example that a command can take up to 10 seconds.",
